# hello-world

(May 21, 2017)
My name is Derek Spalla. I am a slash careerist. A one man band. Project Manager/Instructional Designer/Teacher/Writer with 20 years experience â€“ possessing a passion for learning, a deep connection to technology, and a need for diverse professional and personal interests. Currently I am interested in Python, Data Science, and Big Data.

I am currently teaching myself how to code Python. I tried once before, but life got in the way. I am determined to gain this knowledge over the summer (2017).
